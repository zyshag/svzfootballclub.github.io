<h2 style="color:white;text-align:center;"> FAQ </h2>
<h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;"> why do we do what we do? </h3>
<div style="height:120;width:480;background-color:6EB7F1;border-radius:10px 10px 10px 10px;"> <p style="color:white;text-size:14;"> Our football club was created due to exclusion in the world of sports, in terms of gender, age, and more. At SVZ club we strive to make our lessons inclusive for each child. We came together to create a community where children can pick up sports skills, feel accepted, and reap the rewards of good sportsmanship. We are changing the world, one step at a time!</p> </div>
<h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;"> what are the exercises and drills?</h3>
<div style="background-color:6EB7F1;height:220;width:480;border-radius:10px 10px 10px 10px;"><p style="color:white;text-size:14;"> Our course spans over 6 weeks, 1 lesson per week; 6 lessons in total. In the first lesson, we start them off with exercises that display their previous knowledge and skills, and then decide on how to take it further from there. We split into 3 groups: advanced, intermediate, and beginner, so we can truly focus on what our students need. This is easy as we have 3 coaches. Over the next 4 weeks, we use drills with equipment such as cones, rings, and smaller/bigger balls. We also move children to higher sets once we feel they have achieved a better level of skill. In the last sixth lesson, we plan a big match to play where kids are evenly and equally split into 2 teams where they play a match for 15 minutes. At the end, the winning team gets prizes and all get participation and effort certificates. </p></div>
<h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;"> why do you choose to coach children from 5-10?</h3>
<div style="background-color:6EB7F1;height:161;width:480;border-radius:10px 10px 10px 10px;"><p style="color:white;text-align:center;text-size:14;"> We'll admit, working with children in this age range can be challenging at times, but they really inspire us and even help us become better as coaches and as people in general. During difficult times I learn to persevere, just like my students. They refuse to fail, and they always get up and try again. This is what makes them so motivating for me to keep going and coaching! Teaching the youth can be quite rewarding. You watch them mature and develop as people in addition to as football players. its very inspiring for all!</p> </div>
